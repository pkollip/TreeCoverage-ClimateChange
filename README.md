# TreeCoverage-ClimateChange

Climate change is arguably one of the most pressing issues this planet is facing! In the past 100 years, scientists along with regular people have proposed various solutions to combat climate change. A solution that has been gaining popularity is optimizing tree coverage in order to lower carbon emissions which in lower combats climate change. This KNN model I made utilizes a data set of training and test data with various features such as Carbon Emissions (millions of metric tons), Tree Cover Percentage, Population, and Land Area (sq mi) for the 50 states in the United States to determine the performance of that state in terms of tree coverage to mitigate climate change.
